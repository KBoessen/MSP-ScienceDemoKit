# MSP-ScienceDemoKit
DIY and demonstration instructions for the Science Demo Kit developed by students of the Maastricht Science Programme for use during promotional events. The kit was originally designed for "Het Weekend van de Wetenschap", where the focus lied on bringing science in such a way that younger children can understand and be inspired to learn STEM subjects.
